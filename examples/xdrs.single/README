This example demonstrates using ReSim in an in-house design, the XDRS demonstration
platform. To focus on verification issues, the design is simplified. This example 
illustrates the advanced concepts of using ReSim. It is strongely recommended that 
the readers run the XDRS.QUICKSTART example before running this example. 

TO Run the "XDRS.SINGLE" example:

1. Understand the XDRS design 
    
    1.1 The XDRS design is exactly the same as the "XDRS.QUICKSTART" example
    1.2 Test(s)
    
        This example includes more tests. These tests examine various aspects of 
        the XDRS system (./testplan.xml)

2. Preparations for running simulations
     
    2.1 Create a "settings.do" file in the working folder
    This file is required to setup directory pathes
    
        set RSV_HOME "C:/DPR_TOOLS/ReSim"
        set OVM_HOME "C:/ModelSim6.5g/verilog_src/ovm-2.1.1"
    
        source "$RSV_HOME/scripts/resim.do"
        
    2.2 Run auto_generation.tcl
    2.3 Read ./artifacts/my_solyr_todolist.txt 
    
        The designer need to do step 1,2,3,4 at minimal in order to use ReSim. 
        These steps integrates the generated artifacts into the simulation testbench.
        
        Steps 5,6,7 are for advanced users who wish to change the default artifacts 
        for their purposes. In this example, the modified artifacts are in the 
        "artifacts.edited" folder and they are all copied by the Tcl script.
        
3. Run one single test
    
    3.1 Open simulate_mti.do and change the name of the test to be compiled
        (line 34). For example, to run the random test (tdpr_random.sv), change to
    
        vlog ..... +define+TEST_DPR_RANDOM "./xdrs/xdrs.sv"
        
        Valid test names include:
        
            TEST_DPR_DEMO 
            TEST_DPR_SIMPLE 
            TEST_DPR_READBACK 
            TEST_DPR_EI 
            TEST_DPR_ISOLATION 
            TEST_DPR_RETRY 
            TEST_DPR_RANDOM
        
    3.2 Start ModelSim in the working directory type in the prompt
     
        ModelSim> do simulate_mti.do
   
4. Run all tests and analyze test coverage
    
    4.1 Start ModelSim in the working directory.
     
        ModelSim> do simulate_coverage.do
        
        After simulating all tests, the coverage data of all tests are merged
        to a single database (./coverage/merged.ucdb), and ModelSim generates
        an HTML report (./coverage/covhtmlrpt/index.html). The report compares
        the test results with the testplan (./testplan.xml)
