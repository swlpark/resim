This example demonstrates using ReSim in a reference design released by Xilinx.
It is strongely recommended that the readers run the original design (XAPP883)
before running this example. 

TO Run the "Fast PCIe Configuration" example:

1. Download the "Fast Configuration through PCIe" refernece design 
   
    1.1 Go to Xilinx website and download XAPP883
    1.2 Extract and copy the design files to ./xapp883
   
2 Generate the PCIe endpoint logic 
    (These steps are required by XAPP883, please refer to XAPP883 for how to generate
    the PCIe endpoint and the parameters for the PCIe endpoint)
    
    2.1 Use coregen to generate the PCIe endpoint logic 
    2.2 Copy the endpoint source code to ./xapp883/hw/Source/PCIe_x8_gen1/source
    2.3 Use the files in the custom folder to overwrite the same files in 
        ./xapp883/hw/Source/PCIe_x8_gen1/source
   
3. Integrate ReSim into the reference design 
    (These steps are required by ReSim)
    
    3.1 Create a "settings.do" file in the working folder
    This file is required to setup directory pathes
    
        set RSV_HOME "C:/DPR_TOOLS/ReSim"
        set OVM_HOME "C:/ModelSim6.5g/verilog_src/ovm-2.1.1"
    
        source "$RSV_HOME/scripts/resim.do"
        
    3.2 Run auto_generation.tcl
    3.3 Read ./artifacts/pcie_solayer_todolist.txt 
        The "todolist" file explians the basic steps involved to use ReSim
    
    3.4 Start bash (cygwin, mingw, or xilinx-bash) and cd to working directory
    3.5 Apply the patch 
    
        bash> patch -p0 -i board_patch.txt
    
        You can read the patch file to see the changes involved in order to
        integrate ReSim into an existing simulation environment
    
    3.6 Start ModelSim in the working directory.
     
        ModelSim> do simulate_mti.do
    
4. If successful, you can see the following information in the ModelSim console: 

...
# [34978.046ns] : TSK_PARSE_FRAME on Transmit
# OVM_INFO @ 35477.778ns: solyr.rr0.mon [ReSim] [DURING_PH @ 35447.778ns] SBT_OP::WCFG, rrid= 0x00, rmid= 0x01, module= pcie_app_v6.pcie_bmdma

# [39626.074ns] : TSK_PARSE_FRAME on Transmit
# [39626.074ns] : TSK_SEND_CONFIG_FILE completed
