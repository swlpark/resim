ReSim is a reusable library for RTL simulation of Dynamically Reconfigurable Systems
(DRS). It uses simulation-only artifacts to mimic the behavior of the FPGA fabric
during reconfiguration, and assists designer in detecting bugs BEFORE, DURING and 
AFTER reconfiguration. 

1. System requirement

    ReSim is implemented using SystemVerilog? and OVM library. It has been tested using 
    QuestaSim?/ModelSim? 6.5g on Windows XP Professional SP2 machine and should work on 
    other platforms. The tool also require Tcl 8.4 (or later) and Python 2.5 (or later). 

    The State Migration example requires EDK and has only been tested on EDK 12.4.

3. Running examples
    
    The library includes 3 examples: XDRS, Fast PCIe configuration, and State Migration. 
    The XDRS example further include three versions: XDRS.QUICKSTART XDRS.SINGLE 
    XDRS.MULTIPLE. It is recommended that you run these examples in the following order:
    
        XDRS.QUICKSTART: 
            This example demonstrates the minimal effort to use ReSim.
            
        XDRS.SINGLE:
            This example demonstrates the advanced concepts of ReSim. The concepts
            include, modifying artifacts for test-specific purposes (e.g. monitor, 
            error injection), using coverage-driven verification on DRS designs. 
            
        XDRS.MULTIPLE 
            This example demonstrates the use of ReSim on designs that have multiple 
            reconfigurable regions.
            
        Fast PCIe configuration:
            This example demonstrates the use of ReSim on a Xilinx reference design.
        
        State Migration: 
            This example demonstrates using ReSim to simulate a processor-based design
            with EDK tools. It also demonstrates designing and simulating a system 
            that aesses module state (FF, memory cells) via the configuration port.
